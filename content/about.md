## Intro

Hey, I'm Sam. I'm a software engineer and I specialise in building web apps. My current role is head of technology at Chameleon Creator.

Prior to working at Chameleon Creator, I have primarily worked on building websites, either as a freelancer or as a part of Inspire Group - A Learning Consulting company in Melbourne, Australia.

You can find me on twitter or github and I also hang out on the remix discord. Most places i'll be using the handle @samjohnduke.
